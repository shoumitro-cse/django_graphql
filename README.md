# Building GraphQL APIs in Django with Graphene

GraphQL is an open-source data query and manipulation language for APIs, and a runtime for fulfilling queries with existing data. It was developed internally by Facebook in 2012 before being publicly released in 2015. It allows clients to define the structure of the data required, and the same structure of the data is returned from the server, therefore preventing unnecessary data from being returned.

GraphQL has three primary operations: Queries for reading data, Mutations for writing data, and Subscriptions for automatically receiving real-time data updates. A GraphQL server provides clients with a predefined schema â€“ a model of the data that can be requested. The schema serves as common ground between the client and the server.

In this tutorial we will use Graphene, a GraphQL framework for Python, to build a Django API that uses queries and mutations. some query example are given below..


# API
python manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:7000
http://127.0.0.1:7000/graphql


##  The GraphQL code below is requesting all the books from the database.
query {
  allBooks {
    id
    title
    author
    yearPublished
    review
  }
}


##  single book by its id
query {
  book(bookId: 2) {
    id
    title
    author
  }
}


## Creating a book
mutation createMutation {
  createBook(bookData: {title: "Things Apart", author: "Chinua Achebe", yearPublished: "1985", review: 3}) {
    book {
      title,
      author,
      yearPublished,
      review
    }
  }
}


## Updating an existing book
mutation updateMutation {
  updateBook(bookData: {id: 6, title: "Things Fall Apart", author: "Chinua Achebe", yearPublished: "1958", review: 5}) {
    book {
      title,
      author,
      yearPublished,
      review
    }
  }
}


## Deleting a book
mutation deleteMutation{
  deleteBook(id: 6) {
    book {
      id
    }
  }
}
